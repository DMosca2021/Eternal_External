// figure out how to link the user taking the quiz and user giving the advice 
// 2nd user getting answers share the quiz questions 
//share info between users 
// whatever question you ask 
// link the quiz to the API responses 


// group advice into different categories 
//put certain advice into one array chosen by dead person

Clearly identify what you need to get to MVP by the end of class tomorrow
What MVP is
//2 users
// user 2 dead choses best answers to pass on to their living relatives 
// user 1 is given, advice, or emotional feedback based on what they want from the dead person 

//emotional feedback is given based on text input via  form 
// advice is given based on user 1 choice 
// "do you want advice about ... 1-5"
// quitting something, job advice, relationship, confidence boost, what would you tell me if you were still here  (random)
// Drop down menu 
// whatever advice user 1 choses will be linked to the answer from user 2 
// use APIs

What tasks are being done when, by whom

jill html 
ale css 
devin github
javascript all 


Make sure the team roles are clear to everyone including your TA
Show your TA what you have deployed to github pages so far (can be a mostly empty skeleton)

Should have the HTML main page mostly complete (not necessarily including the dynamic content yet, but that would be good to have)
Remember to do your team assessment (standing meetingâ€¦) at the beginning and end of class.

Show your TA all of the API requests you need working in Postman/Insomnia or with cUrl

JavaScript implementation should be pseudo-coded and actual coding started
Presentation started (skeleton -- 10% complete)
This will also give you an opportunity to review the requirements for the project :slightly_smiling_face:
